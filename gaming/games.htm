            <p>Gaming is something that I have been interested in since I was a kid. When I was a kindergartner, I played my first ever video game, which was either <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> or <i>Contra</i> on the Famicom (or NES in Amerian term), though I don't remember which one exactly I played first.</p>
            
            <p><i>Diablo</i>, which I first played in 1997, was the game that first introduced to me many role-playing game elements, such as level-up, quests, equipments and spells. Being the game that changed my perspective to video games in general, it remains one of my all-time favourites.</p>

            <p>While I have played many different genres and like many of them, I particularly enjoy playing role-playing, turn-based strategy, and maybe to a lesser degree, rhythm games. The following are some (but not all) game series that I have spent a lot of time on.</p>
